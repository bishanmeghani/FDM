USING THE IIS WEBSERVER
-----------------------

Setting up
----------

1. Navigate to 'C:\Users\user.name\My Documents'.
2. In this location, copy and paste the 'Web Application Design' folder from inside the ZIP file
	
Starting the Server
-------------------

1. Navigate to 'C:\Users\user.name\WAD'
2. Find the file named 'launchWebSite' and double click on it.
	This will run a script that will start the webserver for you and load your website.
	
Note
	You will get a windows command prompt when you run the file. If the command prompt 
	disappears then you have not got the setup correct and the server is unable to find your
	website.

	If the command prompt does not disappear then you are ready to go. To shut down the server 
	type in 'q' into the command prompt.
	
	
Where to put your website pages
-------------------------------

1. Once you have the sever up and running you can start hosting your website.
	
2. The web server is configured to look for changes to your website automatically,
	therefore you do not need to keep restarting it.
	
3. The server is also configured to look in ''C:\Users\user.name\WAD\WebSite',
	to find your files. Place any new web pages, css, js and xml files in here if you want the server to
	host them.
	
Note
	You can group the types of files by using folders.
	
Viewing your website
--------------------

1. To view your web site you will need to type 'localhost:7777/page_name.html' into the address bar.
